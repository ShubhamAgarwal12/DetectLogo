# Project Title
Identifying and Locating Logo

## Getting Started

This project will make you familiar to logo identification and matching using the SIFT feature detector and descriptor published by David Lowe in 1999 using its opencv binding in python. The page contains approach and instructions get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The code is developed on Python2.7 with libraries OpenCV, numpy, random and math. This should work fine with later python versions with minor changes.
