## Getting Started

This project will make you familiar to logo identification and matching using SIFT feature detector and descriptor. The page contains details about the approach and instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine with python.

### Prerequisites

The code is developed on Python2.7 with libraries OpenCV, numpy, random and math. This should work fine with later python versions with minor changes.
