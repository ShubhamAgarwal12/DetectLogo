Challenge:

For each probe image in probe.txt, write a script that can:
(1) identify the brand logo in the probe image (if any), 
(2) draw the bounding box around the recognized logo (if any),
And finally, the script should tally the number of correct vs incorrect matches and summarize the accuracy.


Directory contents:
probes.txt - file that contains the list of probe images
probes/ - probe image files (note that the "none" label are images that do not contain one of the 32 provided logo brands) 
logos/ - reference logo images (filename contains the name of the brand)
